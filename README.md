## Overview

`InMemoryDB` is a Python in-memory key-value database that supports transactions. The following functions are supported:
- begin_transaction()
- put(key, value)
- get(key)
- commit()
- rollback()

## Setup and Running the Code

1. **Setup the Environment**:
   - This was developed with Python version 3.12.2. Ensure this is installed.

2. **Download the Files**:
   - Save `main.py` to a chosen folder.
   - Save `test.py` in the same directory as `main.py`.

3. **Run the Code**:
   In order to run either file, navigate to the chosen directory, open a terminal session in this directory, and run python -i [file_name].py
   - Included in the files are test files. If desired, you may simply run the `test.py` file to verify functionality.
   - If you would like to manually verify the functionality, run the `main.py` file by using python -i main.py.
